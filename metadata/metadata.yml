name: Gradient-based learning drives robust representations in recurrent neural networks
  by balancing compression and expansion
description: Code that produces the plots of the manuscript "Gradient-based learning
  drives robust representations in RNNs by balancing compression and expansion". This
  code explores the relationship between dynamics and dimensionality of an RNN trained
  to classify inputs. See the README for more information.
